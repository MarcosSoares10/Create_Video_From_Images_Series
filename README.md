# Create_Video_From_Images_Series
Simple project to Create Video From Images Series using python ang lib FFMPEG.

You need download and include FFMPEG dir on your path to execute it.

The simple goal was take a dir with a big number of images and put it inside a video, then I could do something more on a video editor like DaVince resolve if I wanna it.
